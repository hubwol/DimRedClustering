# **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering of High-Dimensional Biological Data using UMAP**

## **Overview**
This project was completed as part of my capstone module during my studies in Mathematical Methods in Data Analysis at the Technical University of Lodz. It explores the application of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and clustering of high-dimensional biological datasets. The goal is to visualize complex structures, identify patterns, and improve interpretability while preserving local and global relationships.
